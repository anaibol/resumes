I like feeling comfortable with the entire stack needed for a web project, from layout and client-side application structure, to backend development and server infrastructure. I am always pursuing new technologies, frameworks and libraries, and I believe web technologies will be soon a multi-platform standard, used for common mobile apps and even for programming robots! And of course, I am in love with Javascript :)",
